====I have put the codes of the projects that beginners can try here. You can compare the codes after trying them yourself====

  1=      The first project is a number guessing game.
in the number guessing game, your computer selects a number and wants you to find that number.

                            
  2=      The second project can be called a little more advanced than the first project.
We'll wait for the computer to guess the number we're holding.
We will help the computer to reach the correct result by answering the answers offered by the computer with 'L', 'H', 'C'.


  3=      The third project is a rock-paper-scissors game
We are making a game where we can play rock paper scissors with the computer in a simple way.
